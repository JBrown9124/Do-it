# Do-or-Do-Not
Created a social task-managing full-stack web application that allows you to create, share, edit (drawing and image importing features included), and complete tasks with users on your friends list. Includes user authentication, a friends list (received and sent friend requests) and friend alerts (ex. notifying a user when a friend has completed a shared task). Uses Django as the back-end web framework and React.js as the front-end library. All data is queried from and stored in a PostgreSQL database using a ReST API developed with Django.

## Available Scripts for Server


1. Type `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal then press then "enter" key. This will install the required packages for this application to run.

2. The "mysite" outer-parent directory contains a python file called "manage.py" that starts the application. Access this 
outer-parent directory with your terminal. Then type the command `python manage.py runserver` and press the "enter" key. 
(In your terminal type `cd mysite` then press the "enter" key. Then type the command $ python manage.py runserver then press the "enter" key)

## Available Scripts For Client

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
